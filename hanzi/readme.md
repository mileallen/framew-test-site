# 汉字游戏 - Hanzi memory game

## Learn and memorize Hanzi charchters, or whatever else!

It's like one of those Pelmanism tile games - Concentration, *Pexeso*, 神経衰弱, Match-up or [whatever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(tile_game)) you call it. Find matching pairs.

Note: tiles are matched in pairs, in sequence => [1st to 2nd], [3rd to 4th]... and so on. You flip one, then a second, and if they don't match they flip right back. Which implies that the pairing stars anew. If you think the third tile flipped matches the second you just saw, you need to flip that tile next.

Use the 'Edit' button to change the charachters when done with this set. Or, of course, you can use the game to help memorise words in a different language, or indeed, anything else you might use flashtiles for. Kids can pair emojis with second-language words. Endless possiblities!
